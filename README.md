# About
This project is from OneCodeCamp's (```youtube.com/@onecodecamp```) tutorial  ```Create a simple Voting DApp with Solidity```
My self and several in the comments requested the code, but no answer from the creator, so I wanted to share the code. All code is manually typed from the tutorial video, just some minor quality of life improvements. 

# Setup
The examples for setting up the project are for the Sepolia network.

## Prerequisites
1.1. Get the API key, eg. by creating an account at ```https://etherscan.io```\
1.2. Create a wallet and add plugin to browser  eg. ```https://metamask.io/download/```\
1.3. Find a RPC url for your selected network at ```https://chainlist.org``` or ```https://chainlist.org/chain/11155111``` for Sepolia network\
1.4. Within the hardhat directory rename ```RENAME.env``` to ```.env``` and insert your API key, wallet private address and RPC url\
1.5. Get testnet Ether (ETH) on wallet address, ```https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia``` NOTE: This requires having 0.001 ETH on your wallet address on mainnet aprox 3$ worth, can be bought at e.g. ```https://www.binance.com/en/how-to-buy/ethereum```
1.6. Install nodejs ```https://nodejs.org/en/download/current``` NOTE: Install the LTS (Long time support) version, hardhat might not support the others

## Deploy steps hardhat:
2.1. ```cd hardhat```\
2.2. ```npm init -y```
2.3. ```npm install hardhat```Â¨
2.4. ```npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox```
2.5. ```npx hardhat init```
2.6. ```npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network Sepolia```\
2.7. ```npx hardhat verify --network Sepolia "Id of contract given from the previous command"```\

## Deploy steps frontend:
3.1. In ```frontend/script.js``` edit ```const contractAddress``` to the ID from step 2.2\
3.2. In ```frontend/script.js``` edit ```const chainID``` to the chainID from step 1.3 (sepolia is 11155111)\
3.3. Open ```frontend/index.html``` right click within the editor and press ```open live server``` NOTE: This exposes your while Votingdapp directory to your local network, including the .env file with the private key. Only use on a trusted network or preferably continue with the next step\
3.3.1 (Optional Security) Open extensions (```Ctrl+Shift+X```) and right click ```Live Server``` select ```Extension Settings``` -> scroll down to ```Live Server > Settings: Root``` and select ```Edit in settings.json``` and change ```"liveServer.settings.root": ""``` to ```"liveServer.settings.root": "/frontend"```
